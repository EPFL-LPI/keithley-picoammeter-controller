# Picoammeter Controller
## For use with a Keithley 6485 / 6487

Keithley provides the ExceLINK Excel Add In to interact with the ammeter, but it is not user firendly. Thus, this implementation is designed to have a better UX.

**Note** Many instrument operations for the instrument depend on the line frequency. This defaults to 50 Hz.
